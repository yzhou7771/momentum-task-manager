Product: Momentum
Idea: A smart, adaptive task manager that prioritizes your to-dos based on how you actually feel — not how you should feel.
User flow:
Morning notification → User opens the web app → Plans day, dumps tasks via text or voice → AI categorizes and prioritizes them into a smart task list (based on energy type, urgency, etc) → Users can optionally log their mood or energy for better suggestions → Dashboard shows a reorganized, energy-aware to-do list with helpful nudges → In level 2, users can connect health data (sleep, steps, etc) for smarter suggestions
Target audience: Freelancers, entrepreneurs, and students who want to maximize productivity and reduce the friction of task management
Core features:

User authentication and accounts (Supabase)
Smart task list with AI-powered organization and priority suggestions (Claude API)
Voice input for brain dumping (Web Speech API)

Vibe: Warm and gamified — think Headspace meets Todoist. Encouraging, friendly interface with progress celebrations, streaks, and gentle nudges. Rounded corners, warm color palette, delightful micro-interactions.

Level 2: Health/energy data integration, mood tracking, AI suggestions based on energy levels
Level 3: Calendar integration, real-time AI conversations, Pomodoro timer, Habit tracking, Advanced analytics dashboard
Task templates library, API integrations (Notion, Slack, etc.)
